# Package Configuration #
#########################

# This file defines the defaults for all packages. This should be sourced by all
# package scripts.

############
# Required #
############

# The name of the package to manage
NAME=${NAME}
# The version of the package to manage
VERSION=${VERSION}

# The path on ORIGIN_HOST to use for updates
# For GitHub, this should be set to user/repo
ORIGIN_PATH=${ORIGIN_PATH}

#######################
# Reasonable Defaults #
#######################
# These may need to be overridden on a per-package basis.

# The "main" branch of the source repository, for updates.
TRUNK=${TRUNK:-'master'}

# Change this if the repository tags do not map nicely to versions.
# A common example is VERSION=1.2.3 vs TAG=v1.2.3
TAG=${TAG:-${VERSION}}

# Change this if using git://, etc
ORIGIN_PREFIX=${ORIGIN_PREFIX:-'https://'}

# The host to download updates from. This is meant to accomodate mirrors.
ORIGIN_HOST=${ORIGIN_HOST='github.com'}

# This should be left as-is, unless you have a particularly strange case. While
# setting this explicitly allows for handling of whatever bizarre origins you
# require, it is also likely to make it difficult to use alternate sources for
# that package.

# Must always refer to the directory the package is to be installed in.
PACKAGE=${PACKAGE_ROOT}/${NAME}--${VERSION}

# Must always refer to the root of the source repository.
SOURCE=${SOURCE_ROOT}/${ORIGIN_HOST}/${ORIGIN_PATH}

# BUILD refers to the root of the buildable source. Some packages put it in a
# "src" directory, for instance. By default, it is whatever SOURCE is, only
# because this is an intuitive default assumption that tends to be correct more
# often than not.

# All commands for a given package can be found here. There is no separation of
# bin vs sbin, or / vs /usr. These had historic merit, but are questionably
# relevant today.
COMMAND_DIR=${COMMAND_DIR:-${PACKAGE}/command}

# Most importantly, all libraries for a given package can be found here. This
# provides a reliable path for dynamic linking and static libraries.
LIBRARY_DIR=${LIBRARY_DIR:-${PACKAGE}/library}

# Headers for a given package can be found here. By having a consistent,
# predictable include path, we reduce system-specific build requirements.
INCLUDE_DIR=${INCLUDE_DIR:-${PACKAGE}/include}

# Configuration for a given package can be found here. This is effectively a
# package-local /etc, which becomes important when multiple versions of a
# package can be installed on the same system.
CONFIG_DIR=${CONFIG_DIR:-${PACKAGE}/config}

# Similarly, all manuals for a given package can be found here.
MANUAL_DIR=${MANUAL_DIR:-${PACKAGE}/manual}

# And info pages can be found here.
INFO_DIR=${INFO_DIR:-${MANUAL_DIR}/info}

# All other forms of documentation can be found here. This is a bit of a
# catch-all for those packages that ship docs in HTML/PS/DVI/PDF/etc formats.
DOC_DIR=${DOC_DIR:-${PACKAGE}/doc}

# Internal tools for a given package go here. Things that a program might want
# in PATH, but a user probably wouldn't. This is what "libexec" is supposed to
# be, according to the FHS (if you ignore the part where it says using "lib" for
# this purpose is acceptable, as long as you don't do both).
